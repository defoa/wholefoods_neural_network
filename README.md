# wholefoods_neural_network
Dave Wasserman from the Cook Political report has done analysis and found that the types of stores in a district are hihgly correlated to election outcomes. He has found that Wholefoods and Cracker Barrels in particular are a good predictor of election results. Recent elections have shown a high amount of political polarization by area. The questions that arise from this pheonomenon are what is a 'whole foods district' and who are the people that live there. 

	The purpose of this project was to build a model that would take data on a community and try to predict if that community had a Wholefoods. I looked at multiple demographic factors collected by the Census Bureau to build my model. A model build solely on demographic data is highly accurate for predicting the whole foods phenomenon.
